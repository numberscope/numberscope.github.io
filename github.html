    <h1>Numberscope GitHub Conventions</h1>
    <p>Here are some habits that I (Liam Mulhall) have been following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use appropriate labels. (That is, use the "maintenance" label for
        maintenance issues, use the "enhancement" label for new features, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        If an issue is being worked on or someone plans to work on it, that
        person should be assigned.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an issue is not being worked on, but might be worked on at some point
        in the future, it should have the "future" label. It shouldn't have
        anyone assigned.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an issue is to be discussed at the weekly meeting, please label it
        with the "meeting" label.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an issue is part of some larger project, please add it to the
        organization-wide project. (GitHub has a feature that allows you to
        manage projects across repos in an organization.)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
