    <h1>Numberscope Server Administration</h1>
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>
      As of this writing, Numberscope's server is a machine that lives in the
      math building at CU.
      <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/math/jeff-taylor">Jeff Taylor</a> is the
      math department's IT person. He occasionally helps us with the server when
      there's something we can't do.
